Solidus Shipments Add Product
==========================

This extension brings back the `add product` functionality to the `Shipments` tab in the `admin/order` page.

This functionality was removed from Solidus backend with https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/3214. See also https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/3099 for motivations.

Installation
------------

Add solidus_shipments_add_product to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_shipments_add_product', github: 'solidusio-contrib/solidus_shipments_add_product'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g solidus_shipments_add_product:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs, and [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use its factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'solidus_shipments_add_product/factories'
```
